In a Firebase project, I encountered an unusual issue where data wasn't updating in real-time despite using the `onValue` event listener.  The data was correctly written to the database, but the changes weren't reflected in the app's UI. Adding a `console.log` inside the `onValue` callback showed that the listener was indeed triggered with the new data, but the UI remained unchanged.
