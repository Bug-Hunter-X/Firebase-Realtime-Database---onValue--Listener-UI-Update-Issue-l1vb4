# Firebase Realtime Database: `onValue` Listener UI Update Issue

This repository demonstrates a problem and solution related to the Firebase Realtime Database `onValue` event listener not updating the UI even when the data in the database changes.

## Problem
The `onValue` listener correctly receives updated data, but the UI does not reflect these changes.  The problem was likely caused by improper state management or UI rendering outside of the listener's scope.  The code initially failed to correctly update the UI components with the new data received from the database.
